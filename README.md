# Predicting-education-level-of-farmer-s-offspring-using-machine-learning-technique
Education is one of the basic necessities of an individual's life, as it enhances the self-morality, values, and nobility that leads one towards the challenging pathways of the competitive world. Education is now understandable for all scopes of persons. In an agriculture-based country, there's a scarcity of education among the offspring of the farmers as they suffer from poverty besides they are not aware of the importance of acknowledgment. After affecting COVID-19 and natural disasters Amphan the study dropout rate of farmers' childers is increased. This thesis helps to find out the farmer's children's education level that they can attain. The study also proposes preventive steps for dropping out of the offspring of farmers. We have collected raw data from the farmers of the rural area and the classification of these performances can be improved by applying pre-processing to the crude data beforehand applying machine learning algorithms. In this paper, we use advanced ML models like Gradient Boosting Classifier, Decision Trees, Ada-Boost, Random Forest, and Support Vector Machines (SVM) to predict whether farmer's offspring will run or drop out their education. Based on the outcomes, it was viewed that Machine Learning strategies substantiate to be suitable in this zone with the Random-Forest being the highest reliable model for foreseeing dropout rate and education level.
